What?
-----
SoTopless is a leaderboard server that supports 100M users per server. 
It supports C++/Java/JavaScript client SDK for Android, iOS, Linux, and Windows platform. 

Following is the list of features :

*   Post a new score of a user.
*   Get top N users with scores from a leaderboard.  
*   Get rank and score of a user from a leaderboard. 
*   Add different kinds of leaderboards such as weekly, monthly, asia, europe, etc. 

Why?
----
Simple and easy APIs save your time. Focus on your game/app development, instead of designing your ranking database and server.  
SoTopless supports 100M users per server. No more headaches providing leaderboards to huge number of users in your game(or app) anymore. SoTopless fits well with the leaderboard requirements both for your game, and your gamified app.

How?
----
To support 100M users for a server, SoTopless uses ASIO library of Boost for supporting huge number of requests leveraging asynchronous I/O on the server side, and uses carefully designed database engine. SoTopless server is written in C++ supporting major operating systems such as Windows and Linux.
